        <h2> A Day Exploring the Bikini Bottom ...</h2>
        <p> The Bikini Bottom is beneath Bikini Atoll located in the Pacific Ocean. The Bikini Bottom has a population of about <strong> 4.5 million</strong> citizens. The city has also been historically called <em> Bikini Gulch, Dead Eye Gulch, and Bikini Bottomshire</em>. The city is home to many different businesses, a stable economy, an education system, a structured government, etc.</p>
        <p> When traveling to Bikini Bottom you might notice some of the city's well known citizens. I will explain who <strong><em> Spongebob and Sandy</em></strong> are soon. The others include:<em> Patrick,</em> Spongebob's bestfriend; <em> Squidward,</em> Spongebob's mean coworker and neighbor who plays the flute; <em> Mr. Krabs,</em> the CEO of the Krusty Krab who is in love with money; and <em> Plankton,</em> the owner of the Chum Bucket who is seen as  a criminal. There is also Gary, Pearl Krabs, Mrs. Puff, and Karen Plankton.</p>
