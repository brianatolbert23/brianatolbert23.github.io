       <h3 id="History">History of The Bikini Bottom</h3>
       <p>The History of The Bikini Bottom starts with a nuclear bomb which exploded on bikini atoll and spreaded debris everywhere in the ocean.Then a fish by the name of Fred, decided to turn the debris into a city. Thanks Fred! Sadly when he worked on Mr. Krab's house, he broke his leg and died. The city was later renamed Dead Eye Gultch when a human sent a plankton to the bottom of the sea, which turned out to be an evil plankton. It was soon renamed Bikini Bottom for unknown reasons.</p>

       <h3 id="Government"> Government of The Bikini Bottom</h3>
       <p> The Bikini Bottom's government, although uncertain had three different types of governments rule over Bikini Bottom: Monarch, Republic, and Totalitarian.
       <ol>
           <li>Monarch</li>
           <p>The earliest known monarch existed before the 12th century. King Krabs ruled over Bikini Bottomshire and his daughter, Princess Pearl, was the heir to the throne. In the present time, King Neptune governs over the sea. He lives in his own castle at Atlantis, and his castle itself, is very close to the Bikini Bottom city limits. His daughter, Princess Mindy, is princess of the sea, and will be Queen of the Sea someday.</p>
           <li>Republic</li>
           <p>Bikini Bottom's known Republic form of government contains two known positions. The Mayor, Rodger Bumpass, has been known to open unfinished bridges and present the Great Snail Race. The next mayor was Richard Stanford. The most current mayor is Bryonha Marie Parham. The Bikini Bottom also has a President, whom is elected by the residents of Bikini Bottom.</p>
           <li>Totalitarian</li>
           <p>After initiating his evil plan, Plankton brought Bikini Bottom's populace into slavery, renaming it Planktopolis, and becoming a dictator. Thereby creating a Totalitarian form of government. By then, Plankton ruled the city as King Neptune was too busy worrying about himself and both the mayor and president was presumably under Plankton's control. However, SpongeBob and Patrick soon put a stop to this and Plankton was ultimately arrested for his actions.</p>
